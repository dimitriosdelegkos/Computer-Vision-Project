# Dog / Cat Classification - Computer Vision
> Data science project


## Overview
The **goal** of this project is to make a model which can recognize a photo as a *Dog* or a *Cat*.

For this purpose, a *Convolutional Neural Network* is being used.


The data includes 5000 images from dogs and 5000 images from cats. The full dataset can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qaZ9lrM89hGx_e-Jfev4dyxVkuvLswbZ).
